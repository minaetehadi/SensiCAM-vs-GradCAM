#  Grad-CAM and Sensi-CAM Heatmap Generator
Sensitivity Class Activation Map (Sensi-CAM) vs Gradient-based Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM)


This repository contains code to generate Grad-CAM and Sensi-CAM heatmaps using a pre-trained VGG16 model from Keras. The heatmaps are visual representations of where the model is focusing on the input image when making a prediction.
